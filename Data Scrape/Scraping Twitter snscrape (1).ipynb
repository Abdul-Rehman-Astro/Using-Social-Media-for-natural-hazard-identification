Landfall predicted on\\xa0Thursday\\xa0in\\xa0Gurajat.\\n\\nThe coastal regions of Gujarat are on high alert as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warns of an impending storm surge due to the formidable cyclonic storm Biparjoy. Despite a slight decrease in its intensity, the cyclone is anticipated to regain strength, potentially causing widespread destruction in Gujarat through massive storm surges. The IMD has raised a red alert for the coasts of Saurashtra and Kutch, with the cyclone predicted to hit land between Mandvi in Gujarat and Karachi, a port city in Pakistan, on June 15.\\n\\nCyclone's trajectories are based on 4 different weather models\\n\\nThe cyclone's impact is expected to be severe, with complete destruction of thatched houses and significant damage to kutcha houses in various districts, including Kachchh, Devbhumi Dwarka, Porbandar, Jamnagar, Morbi, Junagarh, and Rajkot. The storm also poses a threat to infrastructure, with the potential to topple power and communication poles, disrupt railway services, and cause harm to crops and orchards.\\n\\nThe cyclone is forecasted to bring a range of rainfall intensities to Gujarat's coastal areas, from light to moderate, with isolated places experiencing heavy to extremely heavy downpours. The intensity of rainfall is expected to escalate on June 15.\\n\\nIn anticipation of the cyclone, approximately 95 train services that run through, originate from, or terminate in Gujarat's coastal areas have been cancelled or will be short-terminated until June 15.\\n\\n#BiparjoyCyclone\\n\\nPics at 2:17 AM 15/06/23\",\n",
